This is a copy of the Linux kernel Git repository, with some older versions (before Linux was on Git) grafted on via the [git-replace mechanism](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-replace).

After cloning this repository, please run:

    git fetch origin refs/replace/*:refs/replace/*

You can then browse the full history, including commits before v2.6.12-rc2, the first version imported into Git.
